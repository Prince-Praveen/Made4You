This web project has been made using Django &amp; HTML.

To see through the project files just go to the master branch and there you can see all the files of the project.

To run the project make sure that you have installed Python and Django in your system.

To run the project just open Windows PowerShell in that project file location and enter the following command - "python manage.py runserver".

This command will initiallize the Django server on port number '8000' and will display a HTTP link i.e., "http://127.0.0.1:8000/".

Just copy the url and open in your browser.

That's all. you are done.

And for DataBase Access first you need to create a superuser in the terminal by typing the following command - "python manage.py createsuperuser".

Then it will ask you to type your user name and press enter and then it will ask you to type email(optional i.e, you can leave this as blank also) and then press enter and then it will ask you to type password(it will be not visible on screen but it will be recorded) and press enter and then you have to re-enter your password. That's all, hereby you will successfully created your superuser.

After that you can just type "/admin" i.e., "http://127.0.0.1:8000/admin" in the url tab of your browser.

Enter your superuser credientials. and here you go the DataBase Access.
