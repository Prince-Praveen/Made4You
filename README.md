This web project has been made using Django &amp; HTML.

To see through the project just go to the master branch and there you can see all the files of the project.

To run the project make sure that you have installed Python and Django in your system.

To run the project just open Windows PowerShell in that project file location and enter the following command - "python manage.py runserver".

This command will initiallize the Django server on port number '8000' and will display a HTTP link i.e., "http://127.0.0.1:8000/".

Just copy the url and open in your browser.

That's all. you are done.

Thank You :)
